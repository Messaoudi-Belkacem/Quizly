# ⚙️ **Settings Screen UI Prompt**

> **Scene:** A clean, organized settings panel where users personalize their Quizly experience and manage app preferences.

**Layout Structure:**
- Use a **vertically scrolling column** of clearly labeled setting cards, each with intuitive icons.
- Group related settings into expandable sections: *Appearance*, *Notifications*, *Data*, and *About*.

**Key Settings with Visual Feedback:**
1. **Theme Toggle:**  
   A large, tappable card with a sun/moon icon that smoothly morphs when switching between light/dark/auto modes. The background subtly shifts color in real-time.

2. **Notification Preferences:**  
   Toggle switches with satisfying slide animations and haptic feedback. Include options for daily quiz reminders, streak alerts, and achievement notifications.

3. **Sound & Vibration:**  
   Independent toggles for correct/incorrect sounds and haptics. Each toggle plays a preview sound when activated.

4. **Data Management:**  
   A “Clear History” button that shows a confirmation dialog with a gentle shake animation. Include a “Reset Progress” option with a warning color scheme.

5. **App Info Section:**  
   Version number, developer credits, and a “Rate App” button that pulses gently. Include a “Share App” option with a sliding card animation.

**Visual Tone:**
- Minimal, accessible, and intuitive
- Immediate visual feedback for every interaction
- Consistent with the overall Quizly design system
- Respects system preferences where possible

**Micro-Interactions:**
- Settings save automatically with a small checkmark confirmation
- Section headers expand/collapse with smooth chevron rotation
- Subtle divider lines between sections that fade in on scroll

This creates a **user-friendly, responsive settings experience** that feels integrated and intentional—not an afterthought.
